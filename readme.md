# 🎉 Welcome to Harper's Resume Repository! 🎉

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my professional résumé through various formats, allowing you to view, edit, and understand my background in a structured way. Whether you're interested in my experiences, skills, or any other details, everything is organized for your convenience! 🚀

## 📄 Summary of Project

The aim of this project is to present my résumé in multiple data formats (JSON, YAML) that can be easily converted into a static HTML webpage. By organizing my information in this way, it enables flexibility and ease of use while allowing me to maintain and update it quickly. The HTML output reveals my professional journey, skills acquired, and contributions made throughout my career, along with details about my education, awards, and volunteer work. 

Check out the résumé [here](output/resume.html).
